# Use macOS layout on Windows

These [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) scripts bring macOS keyboard layout and some shortcuts on Windows.

These scripts are intended to work with Apple keyboards, but nothing should hold you back from using it with any other keyboard, if that's what you want.


## Installation


- Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) 
- Run the `macOSKeyboardLayout.ahk` and `MagicKeyboardFnKeys.ahk` files

If it doesnt work for applications running with admin permissions, run scripts as admin or set AHK to run with admin privileges ([from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8457852/723769)). 

## Autostart
- To start scripts automatically, compile them and put in `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp`.
