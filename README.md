Use Mac keyboard with AutoHotkey under Windows
==============================================

This [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) configuration file makes usual keyboard shortcuts work with an Apple keyboard on Windows.

Installation
------------

- Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) 
- Run the `macOSKeyboardLayout.ahk` and `MagicKeyboardFnKeys.ahk` files

If it doesnt work for applications running with admin permissions, run scripts as admin or set AHK to run with admin privileges ([from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8457852/723769)). 

Autostart
------------
- To start scripts automatically, compile them and put in `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp`.
