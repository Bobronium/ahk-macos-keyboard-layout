Use Mac keyboard with AutoHotkey under Windows
==============================================

This [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) configuration file makes usual keyboard shortcuts work with an Apple keyboard on Windows.

If it's not working for applications running with admin permissions, it might be the problem that AHK is not, see [this question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8457852/723769). 

Installation
------------

- Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) 
- Run the `macOSKeyboardLayout.ahk` and `MagicKeyboardFnKeys.ahk` files


Autostart
------------
- To start scripts automatically, compile them and put in `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp`.
