# Use macOS layout on Windows
These [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) scripts bring macOS keyboard layout and some shortcuts on Windows.

These scripts are intended to work with Apple keyboards, but nothing should hold you back from using it with any other keyboard, if that's what you want.


# Installation
- Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) 
- Run the `macOSKeyboardLayout.ahk` and `MagicKeyboardFnKeys.ahk` files

## Autostart
To start scripts automatically, compile them and put in `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp`.

## Troubleshooting
If it doesnt work for applications running with admin permissions, run scripts as admin or set AHK to run with admin privileges ([from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8457852/723769)).

  While I'm trying to keep this repo as a small as possible, only adding shortcuts that I personaly crave on Windows, kinto seems to be an all-around-solition for people who constantly work on macOS/Windows/Linux. Never had a chance to used it, but definitely gonna give it a try.
